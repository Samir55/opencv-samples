Learning OpenCV and need a place to play.

Ok, so how do you compile. 

Trying this:
gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` -o foo hello-world.cpp

Undefined symbols:
  "___gxx_personality_v0", referenced from:
      ___gxx_personality_v0$non_lazy_ptr in ccyR0e4T.o
ld: symbol(s) not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
dao:opencv-samples adamb$

Wrong compiler.  User g++ instead.

 g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` -o hello-world hello-world.cpp 

Copied a test image in and I can now run it like this:
./hello-world test.png

Seems to work with both a png and a jpg file.  

The jpg is too big for the screen, so it's difficult to see.
