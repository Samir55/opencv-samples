Learning OpenCV and need a place to play.


Ok, so how do you compile. 

Trying this:
gcc `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` -o foo hello-world.cpp

Undefined symbols:
  "___gxx_personality_v0", referenced from:
      ___gxx_personality_v0$non_lazy_ptr in ccyR0e4T.o
ld: symbol(s) not found
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
dao:opencv-samples adamb$

Wrong compiler.  User g++ instead.

 g++ `pkg-config --cflags --libs opencv` -o hello-world hello-world.cpp 

Copied a test image in and I can now run it like this:
./hello-world test.png

Seems to work with both a png and a jpg file.  

The jpg is too big for the screen, so it's difficult to see.

Trying Facedetect

 gcc `pkg-config opencv --cflags --libs` facedetect.c -o facedetect

./facedetect --cascade="/opt/local/var/macports/software/opencv/1.0.0_0/opt/local/share/opencv/haarcascades/haarcascade_frontalface_alt.xml" jared.jpg 

Q: Why does it keep running over and over?
A: Because it's using cvCaptureFromAVI() and I'm giving it a JPEG.  It just keeps reading the image over and over again.  I suppose this is ok.
